# Hello there and Welcome to the CV-editor app

### Check out our [CV-app](https://cv-editor-dun.vercel.app/sign-in?redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcv-editor-dun.vercel.app%2F) to see our creation

### How to get started

- First, you need to log in. We recommend using your GitHub account, but using your Google account works just as well.
- Secondly, you’ll arrive at the homepage, where you can do all sorts of things.
- Thirdly, we recommend checking out [Create-CV](https://cv-editor-dun.vercel.app/editor) and creating your CV using our tools.
- Fourthly, once you’ve created your CV, we recommend looking at your [Old-CV](https://cv-editor-dun.vercel.app/previous-cv) so you can edit and change previous ones.
- Fifthly, we recommend visiting our [About](https://cv-editor-dun.vercel.app/about) page to see what it’s all about (it’s a funny one!).

## Here’s how it works:

This website is made to help people create, save, and manage their CVs (a document that shows your skills, experience, and education when applying for jobs).

- You can create your first CV easily using helpful tools.
- There’s a special text editor (called Tiptap) that lets you write and format your CV neatly. You can add headings, bullet points, and other
- styles to make your CV look professional.
- Once you’re done, you can save your CVs on the website, so you can edit or use them later.
